# IoT Foosball

Bringing Foosball to the Internet of Things, with live tracking of games, player statistics, achievements and more.

Foosball is our favourite way to relax and take a break, but as developers, we thought we could do better. Each table, match, and player has a wealth of information related to it. Using that data we can bring foosball into the 21st Century.

Created for the Microsoft oneweek hackathon 2015.

## Building
